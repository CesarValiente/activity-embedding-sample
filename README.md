# activity-embedding-sample
This is a sample app that showcases Jetpack Window Manager's Activity Embedding API.
This sample shows one activity when there is not enough room defined by the split rules defined in the `main_split_config.xml` file located in the `/res/xml` folder.
When there is more display area that is enough to show two Activities side-by-side, it will show them
